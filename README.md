2.Set Your Study Plan – input the subject or task you want to focus on and the time you’ll spend.

3.Start the Focus Timer – the program will block distracting apps and websites while you study.

4.Take Breaks – follow the timer’s scheduled breaks to rest and refresh.

5.Check Progress – after studying, view your tracked study hours and completed tasks.
